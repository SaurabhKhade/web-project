		<h2>What we do?</h2>
		<p>We travell all over the world observe the condition of forest in that area and if we find out that the forest is on the way of destruction, we gather the peoples from that area, we explain them importance of forest and trees in our life. we explain them that we will not survive if trees are gone dead and with the help of them we plant trees, take of that trees and when we realise that now the forest is safe we move on.</p>
		<p>Below is one of our project in which we saved a forest of Khasi hills in shilong, meghalaya. This is just one and we are going to does this work through out our life. But our organisation will go on serving the forests even after our death.</p>
		<div class="content">
			<h5>India<br />Khasi Hills</h5>
			<div id="khasipic"></div>
			<p>The Khasi people are traditionally a forest-dependent community: using the native cloud forest for shelter, firewood, medicine, food and even for spiritual traditions. The Meghalaya state, or "the abode of clouds" in Sanskrit, is of international importance, recognized as one of the wettest places on earth and a biodiversity hotspot. However, the area and the communities are now at risk as the forest is being cleared by charcoal production,  stone quarrying and animal grazing.</p>
			<p><span>Green Planet</span> team with eleven indigenous governments and 75 Khasi villages to restore the forests, using methods like Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and enrichment planting. The local communities play a key role in the restoration: they manage the tree nurseries, perform the required thinning, weeding, establish the natural fire lines and delimit the no-go zones to protect the forest from animal grazing and human interference.</p>
			<p>Through supporting self-help groups and farmer´s clubs, <span>Green Planet</span> empowers them to tackle poverty, unsustainable forest exploitation and to take ownership in restoring their forests. It is done through training and financial support for ecotourism initiatives, animal husbandry, tree nurseries and subsidies for fuel efficient cooking stoves to encourage a reduction in fuelwood consumption. Direct employment opportunities are created for regional community facilitators, forestry managers, accountants, project assistants etc. The Khasi are one of the world’s few matrilineal societies so women are well represented in the project.</p><br />

		<h2>Why we do?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Climate :</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Planting trees is a proven way of transforming arid and semiarid areas. Places with more 
					trees experience frequent rains, and thus, planting trees is a perfect way to stabilize 
					climate.</li>
					<li>Global warming is a major concern for global leaders and environmentalists and 
					afforestation is one of the recommended ways of addressing global warming. Trees help reverse
					the greenhouse effect through the process of photosynthesis as they act as carbon sinks. In 
					other words, establishing new forests create new carbon dioxide holding areas – reducing the
					carbon dioxide in the environment. The overall outcome is the reduction of the effect of
					global warming.</li>
					<li>Trees also reduce the greenhouse effect preventing warmer temperatures as they are the 
					world’s	only natural air conditioners.</li>
				</ul><br>
			<li><b>Health :</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>In the last few decades, people have been producing more and more carbon dioxide through
					their activities like driving, burning fossils, and industrial activities, resulting in more
					carbon dioxide in the air.</li>
					<li> The imbalance has led to more toxins in the air. In addition to carbon dioxide and 
					greenhouse emissions, human activities like construction and driving create dust particles
					in the air affecting the air quality. Trees not only purify carbon dioxide, but they also 
					purify greenhouse emissions. They also trap soil particles in the air resulting in better
					air quality.</li>
					<li>Trees play an important role in purifying the air. People in areas with trees are less 
					likely to suffer from air-related conditions.</li>
				</ul><br>
			<li><b>Water :</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Without clean water, the earth cannot support lives. Humans and animals rely on clean 
					water for their	survival and hence the need to protect the watershed. </li>
					<li>Forests act like a sponge. The trees and soil within them absorb rainfall and melted 
					snow, reducing the risk of extreme flooding. Also, the water absorbed eventually flows into
					rivers and streams that provide us with a steady supply of water.</li>
					<li>  Forests also act like a filter. Filtration provided by just one national forest is
					valued at more than $3 million annually. Every 10 percent increase in forest cover in a
					watershed leads to a 20 percent decrease in costs for water treatment downstream from the 
					watershed. They keep water clean by preventing the runoff of chemicals and soil into 
					waterways.</li>
				</ul><br>
			<li><b>Wildlife :</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Deforestation fractures forest habitat. Animals use trees for food, shelter, and nesting
					sites. But many forest-dwelling animals are threatened, largely because of deforestation and
					forest degradation caused by climate change-induced insects and diseases, droughts and 
					severe wildfires, as well as sprawling development.</li>
					<li>Populations of forest-dependent wildlife species worldwide declined 53 percent between 
					1970 and 2014, on average. Wildlife species are now going extinct at a rate 1,000 times 
					higher than they would from natural factors.</li>
					<li>There are multiple ways to prevent it. However, a better way would be to replace the 
					trees cut down everyday by planting more trees everyday. Although they'll take some time
					to grow, but it will be far more efficient than simply restricting the cutting of trees as
					it won't affect the economy of the country.</li>
				</ul><br>
			<li><b>Soil Erosion :</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The roots of plants anchor soil to the ground. When deforestation occurs, topsoil erosion 
					increases because there are no roots to hold the soil in place, and no vegetation to break the 
					force of falling rain. </li>
					<li>According to the World Wildlife Fund, half of the world’s topsoil has eroded away within
					the past 150 years. Erosion washes soil into nearby waterways, where the increased 
					sedimentation and pollution damages marine habitats and affects local populations that fish
					or drink from the water source.</li>
					<li> Additionally, the erosion of topsoil decreases soil fertility and hurts the very 
					agricultural efforts that are often the impetus for deforestation. In the Amazon rainforest,
					pasture and cropland dominate the clearcut sections of forest. Sedimentary runoff from 
					deforested areas contaminates rivers, affecting everyone who uses that water.</li>
